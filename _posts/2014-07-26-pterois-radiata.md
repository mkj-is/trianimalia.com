The clearfin lionfish, tailbar lionfish, radiata lionfish, or radial firefish (Pterois radiata) is a carnivorous, ray-finned fish with venomous spines that lives in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans. This is the only lionfish species which has spines without any markings. It can also be recognized by the pair of horizontal white stripes on its caudal peduncle.
